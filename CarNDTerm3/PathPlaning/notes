## Model-based vs Data-driven approaches

### Model-based:
Mode a (Assumption a) -> 
            
Mode b (Assumption b) -> Multimodal Estimation Algo -> Predicted Trajectories 
                 
Observations          ->   

### Model based approach
For each dynamic object neary by:
1. Identity common driving behaviors(change lane, turn left, cross street)
2. Define process model for each
3. update beiefs by comparing the observation with the output of the process model
4. trajectory generation 


Data-driven approaches:
Observations  ->     
                     Machine Learning Model -> 
Training data -> 


Data-driven Example: trajectory clustering
Step 1: Offline training stage
1. Got a LOT of Trajectories
2. Clean the data
3. Define some measure of simiarity
4. Perform unsupervised clustering 
5. Define prototype trajectories for each cluster 

Step 2: Onine prediction 
Every update cycle...
1. Observe vehicle's partia trajectory
2. Compare to prototype trajectories (simiarity used for clustering)
